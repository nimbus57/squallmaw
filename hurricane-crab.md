### **Squallmaw – Physical Description:**

**Size:**  
- **Massive** and imposing, standing **3-4 meters tall** at the torso with a **broad, crab-like body** that spans nearly **5-6 meters** in width.
- The Squallmaw’s overall length, including its many legs, reaches **8-10 meters**, making it an unmistakable presence when seen in the open.

**Body Structure:**  
- The **main body** resembles a **massive, armored crab**, with a low center of gravity to help withstand the planet’s higher gravity. The back is heavily protected by a thick, **domed exoskeleton**, marked by ridges and grooves that allow rain to slide off efficiently.
- It has **numerous legs**, **12-16**, positioned on either side of the body, each jointed and armored, ending in **clawed feet** that grip the ground to maintain stability during storms. The legs give it a **crab-like sideways movement**, though it can also move forward or back, adjusting to the terrain.
  
**Torso and Arms:**  
- Rising from the center of its armored body is a **more beast-like torso**, adding an imposing vertical presence. This torso is **muscular**, but protected by segmented **chitinous armor**, especially around the **vital muscle groups** such as the shoulders and neck.
- The Squallmaw has **two large arms** emerging from its upper torso, equipped with powerful, clawed appendages for **digging, tearing through debris, or self-defense**.

**Head:**  
- The Squallmaw’s head is **squarish**, with a heavy, reinforced structure covered in chitinous plating. Its **wide jaws** are built for crushing hard material like rocks, roots, or tough plant matter, earning it the “maw” in its name.
- The head is equipped with **multiple sets of eyes**, designed to provide wide-angle vision, helping it navigate through the poor visibility of storms. The eyes have specialized lenses for seeing in low light and stormy conditions.

**Armor and Exoskeleton:**  
- The **exoskeleton** is most prominent on the central body and the top of the head, providing a tough shell to protect against environmental threats and storms. It has **interlocking plates** along its limbs and torso, which offer flexibility without sacrificing protection.
- This natural armor can deflect debris, rocks, and high winds during storms, giving it the ability to remain active even when other creatures seek shelter.

**Movement:**  
- The Squallmaw moves with a **steady, deliberate pace**, relying on its many legs for stability. Its **sideways crab-like gait** helps it move efficiently, while the broad, spade-like feet keep it anchored even in turbulent weather.
  
**Coloration:**  
- Typically a **muted, stormy gray** or **muddy brown** to blend into its environment, the Squallmaw’s armor may have streaks of **blue-green** or **dull silver**, mirroring the landscape during heavy rains and squalls.
