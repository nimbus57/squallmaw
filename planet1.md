Here’s a **description of the planet** where the **Squallmaw** and other life forms thrive, incorporating the elements we’ve discussed:

### **Planet Overview:**
- The planet is **Earth-like** in composition but larger and with **slightly higher gravity** (approximately 1.2 times that of Earth). The gravity affects both the **biology and structure** of life, making organisms more **stocky** and **robust**. 
- The planet experiences **longer days** and **years**, with extended seasonal cycles, creating distinct **sub-seasons**. Storms, particularly **massive, long-lasting squalls**, define the planet’s ecosystem and culture.

### **Geography and Climate:**
- Vast **forests** and **dense vegetation** cover much of the planet’s surface. Trees are generally **shorter and broader**, with thick roots that anchor them against the powerful gravity and frequent storms. 
- Large **glades** and **open spaces** interrupt the dense foliage, often the result of creatures like the Squallmaw that clear the land by consuming plants, roots, and even soil. These open areas are essential to the regrowth cycle of the planet’s ecosystems.
- The planet’s **oceans and rivers** are rich in minerals and life, feeding the complex ecosystems that exist along the coastlines and inland. 
- **Mountain ranges** are rare but prominent, providing safe havens and regions less affected by the constant storm cycles.

### **Storms and Weather Patterns:**
- The planet’s defining feature is its **endless cycle of storms**, especially the long-lasting **squalls** that can move across entire continents for months or even years. These storms bring torrential rains, powerful winds, and dense clouds that darken the sky for extended periods.
- **Calm periods** between storm cycles are rare and short-lived, and much of the planet's life has adapted to **exist in harmony with the storms**. **Storm seasons** are predictable, with certain regions experiencing nearly **constant rainfall** while others face periods of dry weather before being overtaken by the next storm.
- The **storms are cyclical**, with major **mega-storms** happening every few decades, reshaping entire landscapes and ecosystems.

### **Ecosystem and Life Forms:**
- The planet’s life forms are built to survive the challenging environment, with most creatures evolving to be **smaller** and **denser**, built for endurance rather than speed.
- **Stocky vegetation** with thick stems and broad leaves dominates the landscape, thriving on the constant rainfall and nutrient-rich soil. Plants in open spaces regenerate rapidly after being cleared by natural forces.
- Creatures like the **Squallmaw** are rare but highly adapted to the planet’s storms. These massive, crab-like creatures move easily through stormy weather and play a crucial role in **clearing the land**, helping recycle nutrients into the soil.
- Most animals are **nocturnal** or **storm-active**, with **sensitive eyes and skin** that allow them to survive in the low-light, rain-heavy environment. **Flight** is rare due to the planet’s higher gravity, but **gliding species** that ride the storm winds exist in high-altitude regions.

### **Human and Civilizational Impact:**
- Human-like civilizations on the planet build their societies around the **rhythms of the storms**, constructing low-profile buildings and structures that can withstand the wind and rain. Multi-story buildings are rare and seen as **symbols of wealth** or **advanced technology**.
- **Cities and towns** are located in regions that experience calmer storm cycles, but even these areas must contend with regular squalls. People have developed sophisticated ways to **predict storms**, allowing them to prepare and navigate the environment efficiently.
- **Agriculture** is tied to the **storm cycles**, with certain crops thriving during rainy seasons while others are grown during short dry periods.
